    "## Why\n",
    "My management (mid-management) keep insisting on us taking trailheads (which is a good thing), *except* that it forces us to:\n",
    "* Take trailheads that are not relevant to our roles.\n",
    "* They don't want to allocate time for us to take them, forcing us to either lower our already crazy utilization targets or doing overtime.\n",
    "* They don't care if we do _well_. They only care that we passed the trailheads.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also think it would make for a neat selenium full project, which I haven't gotten time to do since I did an org creator automator more than a year ago.\n",

    "5. Optional: for each module, get the list of all the units, including their URLs\n",
